She looked tired and old .
Her face was seamed with many wrinkles , and was as brown as leather , and every now and then she stopped to wipe the perspiration which rolled down her face .
“ Dear lady , ” said the wily badger , “ you must be very weary doing such heavy work in your old age .
Won ’ t you let me do that for you ?
My arms are very strong , and I could relieve you for a little while ! ” “ Thank you for your kindness , ” said the old woman , “ but I cannot let you do this work for me because I must not untie you , for you might escape if I did , and my husband would be very angry if he came home and found you gone . ” Now , the badger is one of the most cunning of animals , and he said again in a very sad , gentle , voice : “ You are very unkind .
You might untie me , for I promise not to try to escape .
If you are afraid of your husband , I will let you bind me again before his return when I have finished pounding the barley .
I am so tired and sore tied up like this .
If you would only let me down for a few minutes I would indeed be thankful ! ” The old woman had a good and simple nature , and could not think badly of any one .
Much less did she think that the badger was only deceiving her in order to get away .
She felt sorry , too , for the animal as she turned to look at him .
He looked in such a sad plight hanging downwards from the ceiling by his legs , which were all tied together so tightly that the rope and the knots were cutting into the skin .
So in the kindness of her heart , and believing the creature ’ s promise that he would not run away , she untied the cord and let him down .
The old woman then gave him the wooden pestle and told him to do the work for a short time while she rested .
He took the pestle , but instead of doing the work as he was told , the badger at once sprang upon the old woman and knocked her down with the heavy piece of wood .
He then killed her and cut her up and made soup of her , and waited for the return of the old farmer .
The old man worked hard in his fields all day , and as he worked he thought with pleasure that no more now would his labor be spoiled by the destructive badger .
Towards sunset he left his work and turned to go home .
He was very tired , but the thought of the nice supper of hot badger soup awaiting his return cheered him .
The thought that the badger might get free and take revenge on the poor old woman never once came into his mind .
The badger meanwhile assumed the old woman ’ s form , and as soon as he saw the old farmer approaching came out to greet him on the veranda of the little house , saying : “ So you have come back at last .
I have made the badger soup and have been waiting for you for a long time . ” The old farmer quickly took off his straw sandals and sat down before his tiny dinner-tray .
The innocent man never even dreamed that it was not his wife but the badger who was waiting upon him , and asked at once for the soup .
Then the badger suddenly transformed himself back to his natural form and cried out : “ You wife-eating old man !
Look out for the bones in the kitchen ! ” Laughing loudly and derisively he escaped out of the house and ran away to his den in the hills .
The old man was left behind alone .
He could hardly believe what he had seen and heard .
Then when he understood the whole truth he was so scared and horrified that he fainted right away .
After a while he came round and burst into tears .
He cried loudly and bitterly .
He rocked himself to and fro in his hopeless grief .
It seemed too terrible to be real that his faithful old wife had been killed and cooked by the badger while he was working quietly in the fields , knowing nothing of what was going on at home , and congratulating himself on having once for all got rid of the wicked animal who had so often spoiled his fields .
And oh !
the horrible thought ; he had very nearly drunk the soup which the creature had made of his poor old woman .
“ Oh dear , oh dear , oh dear ! ” he wailed aloud .
Now , not far away there lived in the same mountain a kind , good-natured old rabbit .
He heard the old man crying and sobbing and at once set out to see what was the matter , and if there was anything he could do to help his neighbor .
The old man told him all that had happened .
When the rabbit heard the story he was very angry at the wicked and deceitful badger , and told the old man to leave everything to him and he would avenge his wife ’ s death .
The farmer was at last comforted , and , wiping away his tears , thanked the rabbit for his goodness in coming to him in his distress .
The rabbit , seeing that the farmer was growing calmer , went back to his home to lay his plans for the punishment of the badger .
The next day the weather was fine , and the rabbit went out to find the badger .
He was not to be seen in the woods or on the hillside or in the fields anywhere , so the rabbit went to his den and found the badger hiding there , for the animal had been afraid to show himself ever since he had escaped from the farmer ’ s house , for fear of the old man ’ s wrath .
The rabbit called out : “ Why are you not out on such a beautiful day ?
Come out with me , and we will go and cut grass on the hills together . ” The badger , never doubting but that the rabbit was his friend , willingly consented to go out with him , only too glad to get away from the neighborhood of the farmer and the fear of meeting him .
The rabbit led the way miles away from their homes , out on the hills where the grass grew tall and thick and sweet .
They both set to work to cut down as much as they could carry home , to store it up for their winter ’ s food .
When they had each cut down all they wanted they tied it in bundles and then started homewards , each carrying his bundle of grass on his back .
This time the rabbit made the badger go first .
When they had gone a little way the rabbit took out a flint and steel , and , striking it over the badger ’ s back as he stepped along in front , set his bundle of grass on fire .
The badger heard the flint striking , and asked : “ What is that noise .
‘ Crack , crack ’ ? ” “ Oh , that is nothing . ” replied the rabbit ; “ I only said ‘ Crack , crack ’ because this mountain is called Crackling Mountain . ” The fire soon spread in the bundle of dry grass on the badger ’ s back .
The badger , hearing the crackle of the burning grass , asked , “ What is that ? ” “ Now we have come to the ‘ Burning Mountain , ’ ” answered the rabbit .
By this time the bundle was nearly burned out and all the hair had been burned off the badger ’ s back .
He now knew what had happened by the smell of the smoke of the burning grass .
Screaming with pain the badger ran as fast as he could to his hole .
The rabbit followed and found him lying on his bed groaning with pain .
“ What an unlucky fellow you are ! ” said the rabbit .
“ I can ’ t imagine how this happened !
I will bring you some medicine which will heal your back quickly ! ” The rabbit went away glad and smiling to think that the punishment upon the badger had already begun .
He hoped that the badger would die of his burns , for he felt that nothing could be too bad for the animal , who was guilty of murdering a poor helpless old woman who had trusted him .
He went home and made an ointment by mixing some sauce and red pepper together .
He carried this to the badger , but before putting it on he told him that it would cause him great pain , but that he must bear it patiently , because it was a very wonderful medicine for burns and scalds and such wounds .
The badger thanked him and begged him to apply it at once .
But no language can describe the agony of the badger as soon as the red pepper had been pasted all over his sore back .
He rolled over and over and howled loudly .
The rabbit , looking on , felt that the farmer ’ s wife was beginning to be avenged .
The badger was in bed for about a month ; but at last , in spite of the red pepper application , his burns healed and he got well .
When the rabbit saw that the badger was getting well , he thought of another plan by which he could compass the creature ’ s death .
So he went one day to pay the badger a visit and to congratulate him on his recovery .
During the conversation the rabbit mentioned that he was going fishing , and described how pleasant fishing was when the weather was fine and the sea smooth .
The badger listened with pleasure to the rabbit ’ s account of the way he passed his time now , and forgot all his pains and his month ’ s illness , and thought what fun it would be if he could go fishing too ; so he asked the rabbit if he would take him the next time he went out to fish .
This was just what the rabbit wanted , so he agreed .
Then he went home and built two boats , one of wood and the other of clay .
At last they were both finished , and as the rabbit stood and looked at his work he felt that all his trouble would be well rewarded if his plan succeeded , and he could manage to kill the wicked badger now .
The day came when the rabbit had arranged to take the badger fishing .
He kept the wooden boat himself and gave the badger the clay boat .
The badger , who knew nothing about boats , was delighted with his new boat and thought how kind it was of the rabbit to give it to him .
They both got into their boats and set out .
After going some distance from the shore the rabbit proposed that they should try their boats and see which one could go the quickest .
The badger fell in with the proposal , and they both set to work to row as fast as they could for some time .
In the middle of the race the badger found his boat going to pieces , for the water now began to soften the clay .
He cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him .
But the rabbit answered that he was avenging the old woman ’ s murder , and that this had been his intention all along , and that he was happy to think that the badger had at last met his deserts for all his evil crimes , and was to drown with no one to help him .
Then he raised his oar and struck at the badger with all his strength till he fell with the sinking clay boat and was seen no more .
Thus at last he kept his promise to the old farmer .
The rabbit now turned and rowed shorewards , and having landed and pulled his boat upon the beach , hurried back to tell the old farmer everything , and how the badger , his enemy , had been killed .
The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes .
He said that till now he could never sleep at night or be at peace in the daytime , thinking of how his wife ’ s death was unavenged , but from this time he would be able to sleep and eat as of old .
He begged the rabbit to stay with him and share his home , so from this day the rabbit went to stay with the old farmer and they both lived together as good friends to the end of their days .
THE “ SHINANSHA , ” OR THE SOUTH POINTING CARRIAGE The compass , with its needle always pointing to the North , is quite a common thing , and no one thinks that it is remarkable now , though when it was first invented it must have been a wonder .
Now long ago in China , there was a still more wonderful invention called the shinansha .
This was a kind of chariot with the figure of a man on it always pointing to the South .
No matter how the chariot was placed the figure always wheeled about and pointed to the South .
This curious instrument was invented by Kotei , one of the three Chinese Emperors of the Mythological age .
Kotei was the son of the Emperor Yuhi .
Before he was born his mother had a vision which foretold that her son would be a great man .
One summer evening she went out to walk in the meadows to seek the cool breezes which blow at the end of the day and to gaze with pleasure at the star-lit heavens above her .
As she looked at the North Star , strange to relate , it shot forth vivid flashes of lightning in every direction .
Soon after this her son Kotei came into the world .
Kotei in time grew to manhood and succeeded his father the Emperor Yuhi .
His early reign was greatly troubled by the rebel Shiyu .
This rebel wanted to make himself King , and many were the battles which he fought to this end .
Shiyu was a wicked magician , his head was made of iron , and there was no man that could conquer him .
At last Kotei declared war against the rebel and led his army to battle , and the two armies met on a plain called Takuroku .
The Emperor boldly attacked the enemy , but the magician brought down a dense fog upon the battlefield , and while the royal army were wandering about in confusion , trying to find their way , Shiyu retreated with his troops , laughing at having fooled the royal army .
No matter however strong and brave the Emperor ’ s soldiers were , the rebel with his magic could always escape in the end .
Kotei returned to his Palace , and thought and pondered deeply as to how he should conquer the magician , for he was determined not to give up yet .
After a long time he invented the shinansha with the figure of a man always pointing South , for there were no compasses in those days .
With this instrument to show him the way he need not fear the dense fogs raised up by the magician to confound his men .
Kotei again declared war against Shiyu .
He placed the shinansha in front of his army and led the way to the battlefield .
The battle began in earnest .
The rebel was being driven backward by the royal troops when he again resorted to magic , and upon his saying some strange words in a loud voice , immediately a dense fog came down upon the battlefield .
But this time no soldier minded the fog , not one was confused .
Kotei by pointing to the shinansha could find his way and directed the army without a single mistake .
He closely pursued the rebel army and drove them backward till they came to a big river .
This river Kotei and his men found was swollen by the floods and impossible to cross .
Shiyu by using his magic art quickly passed over with his army and shut himself up in a fortress on the opposite bank .
When Kotei found his march checked he was wild with disappointment , for he had very nearly overtaken the rebel when the river stopped him .
He could do nothing , for there were no boats in those days , so the Emperor ordered his tent to be pitched in the pleasantest spot that the place afforded .
One day he stepped forth from his tent and after walking about for a short time he came to a pond .
Here he sat down on the bank and was lost in thought .
It was autumn .
The trees growing along the edge of the water were shedding their leaves , which floated hither and thither on the surface of the pond .
By and by , Kotei ’ s attention was attracted to a spider on the brink of the water .
The little insect was trying to get on to one of the floating leaves near by .
It did so at last , and was soon floating over the water to the other side of the pond .
This little incident made the clever Emperor think that he might try to make something that could carry himself and his men over the river in the same way that the leaf had carried over the spider .
He set to work and persevered till he invented the first boat .
When he found that it was a success he set all his men to make more , and in time there were enough boats for the whole army .
Kotei now took his army across the river , and attacked Shiyu ’ s headquarters .
He gained a complete victory , and so put an end to the war which had troubled his country for so long .
This wise and good Emperor did not rest till he had secured peace and prosperity throughout his whole land .
He was beloved by his subjects , who now enjoyed their happiness of peace for many long years under him .
He spent a great deal of time in making inventions which would benefit his people , and he succeeded in many besides the boat and the South Pointing shinansha .
He had reigned about a hundred years when one day , as Kotei was looking upwards , the sky became suddenly red , and something came glittering like gold towards the earth .
As it came nearer Kotei saw that it was a great Dragon .
The Dragon approached and bowed down its head before the Emperor .
The Empress and the courtiers were so frightened that they ran away screaming .
But the Emperor only smiled and called to them to stop , and said : “ Do not be afraid .
This is a messenger from Heaven .
My time here is finished ! ” He then mounted the Dragon , which began to ascend towards the sky .
When the Empress and the courtiers saw this they all cried out together : “ Wait a moment !
We wish to come too . ” And they all ran and caught hold of the Dragon ’ s beard and tried to mount him .
But it was impossible for so many people to ride on the Dragon .
Several of them hung on to the creature ’ s beard so that when it tried to mount the hair was pulled out and they fell to the ground .
Meanwhile the Empress and a few of the courtiers were safely seated on the Dragon ’ s back .
The Dragon flew up so high in the heavens that in a short time the inmates of the Palace , who had been left behind disappointed , could see them no more .
After some time a bow and an arrow dropped to the earth in the courtyard of the Palace .
They were recognized as having belonged to the Emperor Kotei .
The courtiers took them up carefully and preserved them as sacred relics in the Palace .
THE ADVENTURES OF KINTARO , THE GOLDEN BOY Long , long ago there lived in Kyoto a brave soldier named Kintoki .
Now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her .
Not long after this , through the malice of some of his friends , he fell into disgrace at Court and was dismissed .
This misfortune so preyed upon his mind that he did not long survive his dismissal — he died , leaving behind him his beautiful young wife to face the world alone .
Fearing her husband ’ s enemies , she fled to the Ashigara Mountains as soon as her husband was dead , and there in the lonely forests where no one ever came except woodcutters , a little boy was born to her .
She called him Kintaro or the Golden Boy .
Now the remarkable thing about this child was his great strength , and as he grew older he grew stronger and stronger , so that by the time he was eight years of age he was able to cut down trees as quickly as the woodcutters .
Then his mother gave him a large ax , and he used to go out in the forest and help the woodcutters , who called him “ Wonder-child , ” and his mother the “ Old Nurse of the Mountains , ” for they did not know her high rank .
Another favorite pastime of Kintaro ’ s was to smash up rocks and stones .
You can imagine how strong he was !
Quite unlike other boys , Kintaro , grew up all alone in the mountain wilds , and as he had no companions he made friends with all the animals and learned to understand them and to speak their strange talk .
By degrees they all grew quite tame and looked upon Kintaro as their master , and he used them as his servants and messengers .
But his special retainers were the bear , the deer , the monkey and the hare .
The bear often brought her cubs for Kintaro to romp with , and when she came to take them home Kintaro would get on her back and have a ride to her cave .
He was very fond of the deer too , and would often put his arms round the creature ’ s neck to show that its long horns did not frighten him .
Great was the fun they all had together .
One day , as usual , Kintaro went up into the mountains , followed by the bear , the deer , the monkey , and the hare .
After walking for some time up hill and down dale and over rough roads , they suddenly came out upon a wide and grassy plain covered with pretty wild flowers .
Here , indeed , was a nice place where they could all have a good romp together .
The deer rubbed his horns against a tree for pleasure , the monkey scratched his back , the hare smoothed his long ears , and the bear gave a grunt of satisfaction .
Kintaro said , “ Here is a place for a good game .
What do you all say to a wrestling match ? ” The bear being the biggest and the oldest , answered for the others : “ That will be great fun , ” said she .
“ I am the strongest animal , so I will make the platform for the wrestlers ; ” and she set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape .
“ All right , ” said Kintaro , “ I will look on while you all wrestle with each other .
I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round . ” “ What fun !
we shall all try to get the prize , ” said the bear .
The deer , the monkey and the hare set to work to help the bear raise the platform on which they were all to wrestle .
When this was finished , Kintaro cried out : “ Now begin !
the monkey and the hare shall open the sports and the deer shall be umpire .
Now , Mr.
Deer , you are to be umpire ! ” “ He , he ! ” answered the deer .
“ I will be umpire .
Now , Mr. Monkey and Mr. Hare , if you are both ready , please walk out and take your places on the platform . ” Then the monkey and the hare both hopped out , quickly and nimbly , to the wrestling platform .
The deer , as umpire , stood between the two and called out : “ Red-back !
Red-back ! ” ( this to the monkey , who has a red back in Japan ) .
“ Are you ready ? ” Then he turned to the hare : “ Long-ears !
Long-ears !
are you ready ? ” Both the little wrestlers faced each other while the deer raised a leaf on high as signal .
When he dropped the leaf the monkey and the hare rushed upon each other , crying “ Yoisho , yoisho ! ” While the monkey and the hare wrestled , the deer called out encouragingly or shouted warnings to each of them as the hare or the monkey pushed each other near the edge of the platform and were in danger of falling over .
“ Red-back !
Red-back !
stand your ground ! ” called out the deer .
“ Long-ears !
Long-ears !
be strong , be strong — don ’ t let the monkey beat you ! ” grunted the bear .
So the monkey and the hare , encouraged by their friends , tried their very hardest to beat each other .
The hare at last gained on the monkey .
The monkey seemed to trip up , and the hare giving him a good push sent him flying off the platform with a bound .
The poor monkey sat up rubbing his back , and his face was very long as he screamed angrily .
“ Oh , oh !
how my back hurts — my back hurts me ! ” Seeing the monkey in this plight on the ground , the deer holding his leaf on high said : “ This round is finished — the hare has won . ” Kintaro then opened his luncheon box and taking out a rice-dumpling , gave it to the hare saying : “ Here is your prize , and you have earned , it well ! ” Now the monkey got up looking very cross , and as they say in Japan “ his stomach stood up , ” for he felt that he had not been fairly beaten .
So he said to Kintaro and the others who were standing by : “ I have not been fairly beaten .
My foot slipped and I tumbled .
Please give me another chance and let the hare wrestle with me for another round . ” Then Kintaro consenting , the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again .
Now , as every one knows , the monkey is a cunning animal by nature , and he made up his mind to get the best of the hare this time if it were possible .
To do this , he thought that the best and surest way would be to get hold of the hare ’ s long ear .
This he soon managed to do .
The hare was quite thrown off his guard by the pain of having his long ear pulled so hard , and the monkey seizing his opportunity at last , caught hold of one of the hare ’ s legs and sent him sprawling in the middle of the dais .
The monkey was now the victor and received , a rice-dumpling from Kintaro , which pleased him so much that he quite forgot his sore back .
The deer now came up and asked the hare if he felt ready for another round , and if so whether he would try a round with him , and the hare consenting , they both stood up to wrestle .
The bear came forward as umpire .
The deer with long horns and the hare with long ears , it must have been an amusing sight to those who watched this queer match .
Suddenly the deer went down on one of his knees , and the bear with the leaf on high declared him beaten .
In this way , sometimes the one , sometimes the other , conquering , the little party amused themselves till they were tired .
At last Kintaro got up and said : “ This is enough for to-day .
What a nice place we have found for wrestling ; let us come again to-morrow .
Now , we will all go home .
Come along ! ” So saying , Kintaro led the way while the animals followed .
After walking some little distance they came out on the banks of a river flowing through a valley .
Kintaro and his four furry friends stood and looked about for some means of crossing .
Bridge there was none .
The river rushed “ don , don ” on its way .
All the animals looked serious , wondering how they could cross the stream and get home that evening .
Kintaro , however , said : “ Wait a moment .
I will make a good bridge for you all in a few minutes . ” The bear , the deer , the monkey and the hare looked at him to see what he would do now .
Kintaro went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank .
At last he stopped in front of a very large tree that was growing at the water ’ s edge .
He took hold of the trunk and pulled it with all his might , once , twice , thrice !
At the third pull , so great was Kintaro ’ s strength that the roots gave way , and “ meri , meri ” ( crash , crash ) , over fell the tree , forming an excellent bridge across the stream .
“ There , ” said Kintaro , “ what do you think of my bridge ?
It is quite safe , so follow me , ” and he stepped across first .
The four animals followed .
Never had they seen any one so strong before , and they all exclaimed : “ How strong he is !
how strong he is ! ” While all this was going on by the river a woodcutter , who happened to be standing on a rock overlooking the stream , had seen all that passed beneath him .
He watched with great surprise Kintaro and his animal companions .
He rubbed his eyes to be sure that he was not dreaming when he saw this boy pull over a tree by the roots and throw it across the stream to form a bridge .
The woodcutter , for such he seemed to be by his dress , marveled at all he saw , and said to himself : “ This is no ordinary child .
Whose son can he be ?
I will find out before this day is done . ” He hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them .
Kintaro knew nothing of all this , and little guessed that he was being followed .
On reaching the other side of the river he and the animals separated , they to their lairs in the woods and he to his mother , who was waiting for him .
As soon as he entered the cottage , which stood like a matchbox in the heart of the pine-woods , he went to greet his mother , saying : “ Okkasan ( mother ) , here I am ! ” “ O , Kimbo ! ” said his mother with a bright smile , glad to see her boy home safe after the long day .
“ How late you are to-day .
I feared that something had happened to you .
Where have you been all the time ? ” “ I took my four friends , the bear , the deer , the monkey , and the hare , up into the hills , and there I made them try a wrestling match , to see which was the strongest .
We all enjoyed the sport , and are going to the same place to-morrow to have another match . ” “ Now tell me who is the strongest of all ? ” asked his mother , pretending not to know .
“ Oh , mother , ” said Kintaro , “ don ’ t you know that I am the strongest ?
There was no need for me to wrestle with any of them . ” “ But next to you then , who is the strongest ? ” “ The bear comes next to me in strength , ” answered Kintaro .
“ And after the bear ? ” asked his mother again .
“ Next to the bear it is not easy to say which is the strongest , for the deer , the monkey , and the hare all seem to be as strong as each other , ” said Kintaro .
Suddenly Kintaro and his mother were startled by a voice from outside .
“ Listen to me , little boy !
Next time you go , take this old man with you to the wrestling match .
He would like to join the sport too ! ” It was the old woodcutter who had followed Kintaro from the river .
He slipped off his clogs and entered the cottage .
Yama-uba and her son were both taken by surprise .
They looked at the intruder wonderingly and saw that he was some one they had never seen before .
“ Who are you ? ” they both exclaimed .
Then the woodcutter laughed and said : “ It does not matter who I am yet , but let us see who has the strongest arm — this boy or myself ? ” Then Kintaro , who had lived all his life in the forest , answered the old man without any ceremony , saying : “ We will have a try if you wish it , but you must not be angry whoever is beaten . ” Then Kintaro and the woodcutter both put out their right arms and grasped each other ’ s hands .
For a long time Kintaro and the old man wrestled together in this way , each trying to bend the other ’ s arm , but the old man was very strong , and the strange pair were evenly matched .
At last the old man desisted , declaring it a drawn game .
“ You are , indeed , a very strong child .
There are few men who can boast of the strength of my right arm ! ” said the woodcutter .
“ I saw you first on the banks of the river a few hours ago , when you pulled up that large tree to make a bridge across the torrent .
Hardly able to believe what I saw I followed you home .
Your strength of arm , which I have just tried , proves what I saw this afternoon .
When you are full-grown you will surely be the strongest man in all Japan .
It is a pity that you are hidden away in these wild mountains . ” Then he turned to Kintaro ’ s mother : “ And you , mother , have you no thought of taking your child to the Capital , and of teaching him to carry a sword as befits a samurai ( a Japanese knight ) ? ” “ You are very kind to take so much interest in my son . ” replied the mother ; “ but he is as you see , wild and uneducated , and I fear it would be very difficult to do as you say .
Because of his great strength as an infant I hid him away in this unknown part of the country , for he hurt every one that came near him .
I have often wished that I could , one day , see my boy a knight wearing two swords , but as we have no influential friend to introduce us at the Capital , I fear my hope will never come true . ” “ You need not trouble yourself about that .
To tell you the truth I am no woodcutter !
I am one of the great generals of Japan .
My name is Sadamitsu , and I am a vassal of the powerful Lord Minamoto-no-Raiko .
He ordered me to go round the country and look for boys who give promise of remarkable strength , so that they may be trained as soldiers for his army .
I thought that I could best do this by assuming the disguise of a woodcutter .
By good fortune , I have thus unexpectedly come across your son .
Now if you really wish him to be a SAMURAI ( a knight ) , I will take him and present him to the Lord Raiko as a candidate for his service .
What do you say to this ? ” As the kind general gradually unfolded his plan the mother ’ s heart was filled with a great joy .
She saw that here was a wonderful chance of the one wish of her life being fulfilled — that of seeing Kintaro a SAMURAI before she died .
Bowing her head to the ground , she replied : “ I will then intrust my son to you if you really mean what you say . ” Kintaro had all this time been sitting by his mother ’ s side listening to what they said .
When his mother finished speaking , he exclaimed : “ Oh , joy !
joy !
I am to go with the general and one day I shall be a SAMURAI ! ” Thus Kintaro ’ s fate was settled , and the general decided to start for the Capital at once , taking Kintaro with him .
It need hardly be said that Yama-uba was sad at parting with her boy , for he was all that was left to her .
But she hid her grief with a strong face , as they say in Japan .
She knew that it was for her boy ’ s good that he should leave her now , and she must not discourage him just as he was setting out .
Kintaro promised never to forget her , and said that as soon as he was a knight wearing two swords he would build her a home and take care of her in her old age .
All the animals , those he had tamed to serve him , the bear , the deer , the monkey , and the hare , as soon as they found out that he was going away , came to ask if they might attend him as usual .
When they learned that he was going away for good they followed him to the foot of the mountain to see him off .
“ Kimbo , ” said his mother , “ mind and be a good boy . ” “ Mr.
Kintaro , ” said the faithful animals , “ we wish you good health on your travels . ” Then they all climbed a tree to see the last of him , and from that height they watched him and his shadow gradually grow smaller and smaller , till he was lost to sight .
The general Sadamitsu went on his way rejoicing at having so unexpectedly found such a prodigy as Kintaro .
Having arrived at their destination the general took Kintaro at once to his Lord , Minamoto-no-Raiko , and told him all about Kintaro and how he had found the child .
Lord Raiko was delighted with the story , and having commanded Kintaro to be brought to him , made him one of his vassals at once .
Lord Raiko ’ s army was famous for its band called “ The Four Braves . ” These warriors were chosen by himself from amongst the bravest and strongest of his soldiers , and the small and well-picked band was distinguished throughout the whole of Japan for the dauntless courage of its men .
When Kintaro grew up to be a man his master made him the Chief of the Four Braves .
He was by far the strongest of them all .
Soon after this event , news was brought to the city that a cannibal monster had taken up his abode not far away and that people were stricken with fear .
Lord Raiko ordered Kintaro to the rescue .
He immediately started off , delighted at the prospect of trying his sword .
Surprising the monster in its den , he made short work of cutting off its great head , which he carried back in triumph to his master .
Kintaro now rose to be the greatest hero of his country , and great was the power and honor and wealth that came to him .
He now kept his promise and built a comfortable home for his old mother , who lived happily with him in the Capital to the end of her days .
Is not this the story of a great hero ?
THE STORY OF PRINCESS HASE .
A STORY OF OLD JAPAN Many , many years ago there lived in Nara , the ancient Capital of Japan , a wise State minister , by name Prince Toyonari Fujiwara .
His wife was a noble , good , and beautiful woman called Princess Murasaki ( Violet ) .
They had been married by their respective families according to Japanese custom when very young , and had lived together happily ever since .
They had , however , one cause for great sorrow , for as the years went by no child was born to them .
This made them very unhappy , for they both longed to see a child of their own who would grow up to gladden their old age , carry on the family name , and keep up the ancestral rites when they were dead .
The Prince and his lovely wife , after long consultation and much thought , determined to make a pilgrimage to the temple of Hase-no-Kwannon ( Goddess of Mercy at Hase ) , for they believed , according to the beautiful tradition of their religion , that the Mother of Mercy , Kwannon , comes to answer the prayers of mortals in the form that they need the most .
Surely after all these years of prayer she would come to them in the form of a beloved child in answer to their special pilgrimage , for that was the greatest need of their two lives .
Everything else they had that this life could give them , but it was all as nothing because the cry of their hearts was unsatisfied .
So the Prince Toyonari and his wife went to the temple of Kwannon at Hase and stayed there for a long time , both daily offering incense and praying to Kwannon , the Heavenly Mother , to grant them the desire of their whole lives .
And their prayer was answered .
A daughter was born at last to the Princess Murasaki , and great was the joy of her heart .
On presenting the child to her husband , they both decided to call her Hase-Hime , or the Princess of Hase , because she was the gift of the Kwannon at that place .
They both reared her with great care and tenderness , and the child grew in strength and beauty .
When the little girl was five years old her mother fell dangerously ill and all the doctors and their medicines could not save her .
A little before she breathed her last she called her daughter to her , and gently stroking her head , said : “ Hase-Hime , do you know that your mother cannot live any longer ?
Though I die , you must grow up a good girl .
Do your best not to give trouble to your nurse or any other of your family .
Perhaps your father will marry again and some one will fill my place as your mother .
If so do not grieve for me , but look upon your father ’ s second wife as your true mother , and be obedient and filial to both her and your father .
Remember when you are grown up to be submissive to those who are your superiors , and to be kind to all those who are under you .
Don ’ t forget this .
I die with the hope that you will grow up a model woman . ” Hase-Hime listened in an attitude of respect while her mother spoke , and promised to do all that she was told .
There is a proverb which says “ As the soul is at three so it is at one hundred , ” and so Hase-Hime grew up as her mother had wished , a good and obedient little Princess , though she was now too young to understand how great was the loss of her mother .
Not long after the death of his first wife , Prince Toyonari married again , a lady of noble birth named Princess Terute .
Very different in character , alas !
to the good and wise Princess Murasaki , this woman had a cruel , bad heart .
She did not love her step-daughter at all , and was often very unkind to the little motherless girl , saying to herself : “ This is not my child !
this is not my child ! ” But Hase-Hime bore every unkindness with patience , and even waited upon her step-mother kindly and obeyed her in every way and never gave any trouble , just as she had been trained by her own good mother , so that the Lady Terute had no cause for complaint against her .
The little Princess was very diligent , and her favorite studies were music and poetry .
She would spend several hours practicing every day , and her father had the most proficient of masters he could find to teach her the koto ( Japanese harp ) , the art of writing letters and verse .
When she was twelve years of age she could play so beautifully that she and her step-mother were summoned to the Palace to perform before the Emperor .
It was the Festival of the Cherry Flowers , and there were great festivities at the Court .
The Emperor threw himself into the enjoyment of the season , and commanded that Princess Hase should perform before him on the koto , and that her mother Princess Terute should accompany her on the flute .
The Emperor sat on a raised dais , before which was hung a curtain of finely-sliced bamboo and purple tassels , so that His Majesty might see all and not be seen , for no ordinary subject was allowed to look upon his sacred face .
Hase-Hime was a skilled musician though so young , and often astonished her masters by her wonderful memory and talent .
On this momentous occasion she played well .
But Princess Terute , her step-mother , who was a lazy woman and never took the trouble to practice daily , broke down in her accompaniment and had to request one of the Court ladies to take her place .
This was a great disgrace , and she was furiously jealous to think that she had failed where her step-daughter succeeded ; and to make matters worse the Emperor sent many beautiful gifts to the little Princess to reward her for playing so well at the Palace .
There was also now another reason why Princess Terute hated her step-daughter , for she had had the good fortune to have a son born to her , and in her inmost heart she kept saying : “ If only Hase-Hime were not here , my son would have all the love of his father . ” And never having learned to control herself , she allowed this wicked thought to grow into the awful desire of taking her step-daughter ’ s life .
So one day she secretly ordered some poison and poisoned some sweet wine .
This poisoned wine she put into a bottle .
Into another similar bottle she poured some good wine .
It was the occasion of the Boys ’ Festival on the fifth of May , and Hase-Hime was playing with her little brother .
All his toys of warriors and heroes were spread out and she was telling him wonderful stories about each of them .
They were both enjoying themselves and laughing merrily with their attendants when his mother entered with the two bottles of wine and some delicious cakes .
“ You are both so good and happy . ” said the wicked Princess Terute with a smile , “ that I have brought you some sweet wine as a reward — and here are some nice cakes for my good children . ” And she filled two cups from the different bottles .
Hase-Hime , never dreaming of the dreadful part her step-mother was acting , took one of the cups of wine and gave to her little step brother the other that had been poured out for him .
The wicked woman had carefully marked the poisoned bottle , but on coming into the room she had grown nervous , and pouring out the wine hurriedly had unconsciously given the poisoned cup to her own child .
All this time she was anxiously watching the little Princess , but to her amazement no change whatever took place in the young girl ’ s face .
Suddenly the little boy screamed and threw himself on the floor , doubled up with pain .
His mother flew to him , taking the precaution to upset the two tiny jars of wine which she had brought into the room , and lifted him up .
The attendants rushed for the doctor , but nothing could save the child — he died within the hour in his mother ’ s arms .
Doctors did not know much in those ancient times , and it was thought that the wine had disagreed with the boy , causing convulsions of which he died .
Thus was the wicked woman punished in losing her own child when she had tried to do away with her step-daughter ; but instead of blaming herself she began to hate Hase-Hime more than ever in the bitterness and wretchedness of her own heart , and she eagerly watched for an opportunity to do her harm , which was , however , long in coming .
When Hase-Hime was thirteen years of age , she had already become mentioned as a poetess of some merit .
This was an accomplishment very much cultivated by the women of old Japan and one held in high esteem .
It was the rainy season at Nara , and floods were reported every day as doing damage in the neighborhood .
The river Tatsuta , which flowed through the Imperial Palace grounds , was swollen to the top of its banks , and the roaring of the torrents of water rushing along a narrow bed so disturbed the Emperor ’ s rest day and night , that a serious nervous disorder was the result .
An Imperial Edict was sent forth to all the Buddhist temples commanding the priests to offer up continuous prayers to Heaven to stop the noise of the flood .
But this was of no avail .
Then it was whispered in Court circles that the Princess Hase , the daughter of Prince Toyonari Fujiwara , second minister at Court , was the most gifted poetess of the day , though still so young , and her masters confirmed the report .
Long ago , a beautiful and gifted maiden-poetess had moved Heaven by praying in verse , had brought down rain upon a land famished with drought — so said the ancient biographers of the poetess Ono-no-Komachi .
If the Princess Hase were to write a poem and offer it in prayer , might it not stop the noise of the rushing river and remove the cause of the Imperial illness ?
What the Court said at last reached the ears of the Emperor himself , and he sent an order to the minister Prince Toyonari to this effect .
Great indeed was Hase-Hime ’ s fear and astonishment when her father sent for her and told her what was required of her .
Heavy , indeed , was the duty that was laid on her young shoulders — that of saving the Emperor ’ s life by the merit of her verse .
At last the day came and her poem was finished .
It was written on a leaflet of paper heavily flecked with gold-dust .
With her father and attendants and some of the Court officials , she proceeded to the bank of the roaring torrent and raising up her heart to Heaven , she read the poem she had composed , aloud , lifting it heavenwards in her two hands .
Strange indeed it seemed to all those standing round .
The waters ceased their roaring , and the river was quiet in direct answer to her prayer .
After this the Emperor soon recovered his health .
His Majesty was highly pleased , and sent for her to the Palace and rewarded her with the rank of Chinjo — that of Lieutenant-General — to distinguish her .
From that time she was called Chinjo-hime , or the Lieutenant-General Princess , and respected and loved by all .
There was only one person who was not pleased at Hase-Hime ’ s success .
That one was her stepmother .
Forever brooding over the death of her own child whom she had killed when trying to poison her step-daughter , she had the mortification of seeing her rise to power and honor , marked by Imperial favor and the admiration of the whole Court .
Her envy and jealousy burned in her heart like fire .
Many were the lies she carried to her husband about Hase-Hime , but all to no purpose .
He would listen to none of her tales , telling her sharply that she was quite mistaken .
At last the step-mother , seizing the opportunity of her husband ’ s absence , ordered one of her old servants to take the innocent girl to the Hibari Mountains , the wildest part of the country , and to kill her there .
She invented a dreadful story about the little Princess , saying that this was the only way to prevent disgrace falling upon the family — by killing her .
Katoda , her vassal , was bound to obey his mistress .
Anyhow , he saw that it would be the wisest plan to pretend obedience in the absence of the girl ’ s father , so he placed Hase-Hime in a palanquin and accompanied her to the most solitary place he could find in the wild district .
The poor child knew there was no good in protesting to her unkind step-mother at being sent away in this strange manner , so she went as she was told .
But the old servant knew that the young Princess was quite innocent of all the things her step-mother had invented to him as reasons for her outrageous orders , and he determined to save her life .
Unless he killed her , however , he could not return to his cruel task-mistress , so he decided to stay out in the wilderness .
With the help of some peasants he soon built a little cottage , and having sent secretly for his wife to come , these two good old people did all in their power to take care of the now unfortunate Princess .
She all the time trusted in her father , knowing that as soon as he returned home and found her absent , he would search for her .
Prince Toyonari , after some weeks , came home , and was told by his wife that his daughter Hime had done something wrong and had run away for fear of being punished .
He was nearly ill with anxiety .
Every one in the house told the same story — that Hase-Hime had suddenly disappeared , none of them knew why or whither .
For fear of scandal he kept the matter quiet and searched everywhere he could think of , but all to no purpose .
